Our custom addition to Team 10's project was a customized GUI using the CImg Library:

To make this GUI we designed a few frames that would be used often, like the ship selection screen, a screen for use between turns,
and a few menu screens.

We were able to check for user interactions with the application using events built into the CImg library. This gave us the ability to let the user
use their mouse as an input device for interacting with the game as well as use their arrow keys for selecting the orientation of their ships.

The development of the GUI necessitated a redesign of the Executive.h and Executive.cpp files since we needed to implement an event loop checking for
user's interactions.
